# Project Information
A full-stack restaurant reservation system allows users to manage dining bookings across multiple branches.

It provides: 
- An interface open to public users
  - View restaurant availability and login.
- An interface accessible to logged-in users
  - Perform semantic searches on availability.
  - Create, view, edit, and cancel reservations.
  - Manage guest counts (adults and children) and select specific branches.
- RESTful APIs
  - Public APIs for performing complete CRUD operations on reservations.
  - Filtering capabilities for integration with external systems.

More details of each of the functionalities are introduced below. 

# Project File Introduction
Here’s a brief overview of the important files in this project:

## `server.js`
The server.js file is the main entry point for the Express server. It configures the MongoDB connection using Mongoose, sets up session management via `cookie-session`, initializes the EJS template engine, and defines the middleware for parsing requests. It aggregates routes for authentication, web interface, and API endpoints.

## `package.json`
- `bcrypt`: ^5.0.0
- `cookie-session`: ^1.4.0
- `dotenv`: ^8.2.0
- `ejs`: ^3.1.6
- `express`: ^4.17.1
- `mongoose`: ^5.12.3
- `nodemon`: ^2.0.7

## `models`
- `User.js`
  - Defines the User schema with name, contact, email, and hashed password.
  - Includes tracking for deletion history and cooldown periods.
- `Reservation.js`
  - Defines the Reservation schema linking to Users.
  - Stores branch, date, time, guest counts, and status (active/cancelled).

## `views`
- `login.ejs`
- `register.ejs`
- `home.ejs`
- `dashboard.ejs`
- `create-reservation.ejs`
- `edit-reservation.ejs`

## `public`
- `style.css`
  - Contains styling for the responsive web interface.

### 4. Update Reservation
**Endpoint:**
PUT /api/reservations/:id

**Description:**
Updates an existing reservation. You may send only the fields that need to change. Server-side validation still applies (e.g., total guests ≤ 12 and December 2025 window).

**URL Parameters:**
- `id` (required): Reservation ID.
