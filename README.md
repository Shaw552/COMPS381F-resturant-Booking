## `server.js`
The server.js file is the main entry point for the Express server. It configures the MongoDB connection using Mongoose, sets up session management via `cookie-session`, initializes the EJS template engine, and defines the middleware for parsing requests. It aggregates routes for authentication, web interface, and API endpoints.

## `models`
- `User.js`
  - Defines the User schema with name, contact, email, and hashed password.
  - Includes tracking for deletion history and cooldown periods.
- `Reservation.js`
